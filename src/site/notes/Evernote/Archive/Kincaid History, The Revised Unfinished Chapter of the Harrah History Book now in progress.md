**KINCAID HISTORY


The Revised Unfinished Chapter of the "Harrah History" Book, A work now in progress.

By Richard Bradley

**THE KINCAID FAMILY

**Thomas Kincaid**
(abt. 1742-bef. 1817) of Muddy Creek Mountain and his wife Hannah Tincher (abt. 1740-aft. 1819) were the parents of the Elizabeth Kincaid who married Daniel O'Hara (Harrah), Jr. They were also the parents of the Margaret Kincaid who married Daniel's brother, Charles O'Hara (Harrah). The Kincaids were very numerous in Augusta, Albemarle, and other counties of western Virginia. Many versions of the origins of the Kincaids in these counties exist.

### Part 1 ... Background on the Early Kincaids of Virginia

Before we begin with the actual history of Thomas Kincaid, it might be best to review the general research on the early Kincaids in Augusta and Albemarle Counties.

The most often quoted story is the tradition that the first immigrant of the Virginia Kincaids was David Kincaid, the brother of James Kincaid, then the laird of Lennox Castle in Scotland. The Kincaids supported the Stuart case, supposedly because they were related by blood and tradition to the Stuart clan. David Kincaid was involved in the unsuccessful rebellion of 1715 and was forced to flee Scotland. He came to Spotsylvania, Virginia where he took up land with George Robinson. Later he moved to Albemarle County and Augusta County, Virginia, later to Bath County, Virginia, finally dying in Washington County, Virginia in 1779. David Kincaid's wife was Winifred Hobson and his known children (from his will) were John, Joseph, Hobson, Burroughs, Jean, and Isabella. He may have had other children who died before 1779. Our Thomas Kincaid was apparently not his son.

Back in Scotland, four nephews of the above David Kincaid by the names of Samuel, George, James, and Robert (sons of David's brother, Alexander), were in the battle of Culloden in 1745-1746 in support of Bonnie Prince Charlie, the Pretender and suffered capture by the English at his defeat. The capture took place near the Castle Kincaid and the wives of the two married brothers were sent to Glasgow with their belongings. All four brothers were released from captivity, possibly by bribery, and, along with their families, were put aboard a ship sailing for America.

At the advice of their uncle David Kincaid, back in Albemarle/Augusta County, Virginia at this time, they brought plenty of "Siller" (silver) with them. The brothers came first to Pennsylvania, as David had probably done, then to Virginia.

Of the above family, David, the uncle, was said to be born about 1680-1700. The nephews were probably born about 1700-1720. [[Evernote/Archive/Kincaid History, The Revised Unfinished Chapter of the Harrah History Book now in progress#1\|#1]]

Regarding such traditions, the only thing that can be said for certain was that David Kincaid did appear in Spotsylvania and Orange Co. records as early as the 1730's. I was informed by Robert Walters that there is a marriage record in Spotsylvania Co. in late 1728 or early 1729 for the marriage of David Kincaid to Winifred Hobson Tillary (she being the widow of Samuel Tillary). [[Evernote/Archive/Kincaid History, The Revised Unfinished Chapter of the Harrah History Book now in progress#2\|#2]] This firmly places David as the earliest Kincaid in Virginia and one would suspect him to be the father or grandfather of all subsequent generations. However, as we shall see, there were other Kincaids in Virginia records who were old enough to be brothers or cousins to David.

The following are abstracts of land records for David Kincaid. Although not an exhaustive list, all records of Albemarle County and related records from other counties are included:

David Kincaid and his son John have deeds in Washington Co. beginning in 1785-87. The following is a sample:

July 9, 1787: Washington Co. Grant to David Kinkead for 350 acres on the Eleven mile Creek adjoining his settlement (Langdon) (Grant #11. P. 682)

David Kincaid was omnipresent in Augusta and Albemarle counties and seems to be associated with all the other early Kincaids in these counties but his exact relationship to them is unknown. David left a will in Washington County, Virginia probated in 1779. In the will his wife Winifred is named along with his children John, Hobson, Burroughs, and Joseph. Jean and Isabella have long been thought to be his daughters but they are not listed in his will and there is no proof of his parentage. Later in this chapter we will examine records for his son John.

### Part 2 ... Thomas Kincaid of Augusta County

Thomas Kincaid (1704-1750) came from Carlisle, Cumberland Co., Pennsylvania to Augusta County, Virginia in 1747 where he purchased 263 acres on the Calfpasture River. This land joined 520 acres which David and John (son of David) Kincaid had purchased in 1764. Thomas died an intestate in 1750 leaving a widow Margaret (Lockhart) Kincaid and at least one child. Court records document that he had a son named William Kincaid but there is no documentation for other children. Some researchers have suggested that our Thomas Kincaid was a probable son of the above Thomas and Margaret Kincaid but this does not appear to be correct. Larry Shuck, in his book Our Families, places the Thomas Kincaid who came to Augusta County in 1747 as a brother to the immigrant David Kincaid. The following are three different lineages proposed by researchers for the Thomas Kincaid who married Margaret Lockhart:

Samuel Kincade = Eliz. Stone

He, born 1687, she 1786 in

Devonshire, Scot.; married

1704; Eliz. died in OH or

VA [[Evernote/Archive/Kincaid History, The Revised Unfinished Chapter of the Harrah History Book now in progress#5\|#5]]

_or_

James Kincaid = \_\_\_\_\_\_

Of Scotland, son of

James, Laird of-that-ilk\*4

_or_

Robert Kincaid = Eliz. North

He, 1686-1760.Father Joseph

Kincaid went to near Dublin,

Ireland in 1701. Robert married

married Eliz. In 1705. [[Evernote/Archive/Kincaid History, The Revised Unfinished Chapter of the Harrah History Book now in progress#6\|#6]]

_A son of one of the above lineages:_

Thomas Kincaid = Margaret Lockhart [[Evernote/Archive/Kincaid History, The Revised Unfinished Chapter of the Harrah History Book now in progress#7\|#7]]

B. 1704-1705 d. 1750

Came from Carlisle, Cumberland Co., PA [[Evernote/Archive/Kincaid History, The Revised Unfinished Chapter of the Harrah History Book now in progress#8\|#8]]

to Augusta Co., VA in 1747.

The children and probable children of Thomas and Margaret Kincaid, according to Larry Shuck, were William, _Thomas_, John and Andrew. According to Doug McGuire, there were two William Kincaids in Augusta County, one who married Eleanor Guy and whose children were the victims of a famous Indian abduction which has been written about extensively. The other William, according to Doug McGuire was William the Stiller [[Evernote/Archive/Kincaid History, The Revised Unfinished Chapter of the Harrah History Book now in progress#8a\|#8a]] who remained in Augusta County while the other William went to Woodford County, Kentucky. There is documentation that a William was the son of Thomas Kincaid and Margaret Lockhart. It is the information about his brothers and sisters which seems to be as much speculation as fact. Doug McGuire has provided me with information on his research in which he traces another Thomas Kincaid, Jr., the one married to Isabella, as the son of Thomas Kincaid and Margaret Lockhart. This Thomas Kincaid, Jr. was referred to as a Blacksmith in deeds in mid 1770's. He and his brother, William Kincaid, the Stiller, owned land on the Calfpasture River. Thomas was born about 1741, according to Doug McGuire, and the children of Thomas & Isabella were Elizabeth, Andrew, Thomas, David, Archibald, John, William, and Robert who later show up in Bath and Monroe Co., VA The following Augusta Co. Records apparently belong to this other Thomas Kincaid although it is possible that some may concern our Thomas Kincaid of Muddy Creek Mountain:

Following allowed Certificates for land for military service... Wm. Kinkead, _Thomas Kinkead_, John Montgomery, of Capt. Lewis' Company, Boquet's Expedition, 1764. [[Evernote/Archive/Kincaid History, The Revised Unfinished Chapter of the Harrah History Book now in progress#9\|#9]]

June 15, 1770: Moses McElvain and wife Margaret of the County of Augusta sold to _Thomas Kincaid_ of Augusta County 260 acres on the south side of the great river of the Calfpasture lying between William Kinkeads and Robert Gwins land originally conveyed by James Loughridge to McElvain. Witnesses: John Kinkead, William Kinkead. [[Evernote/Archive/Kincaid History, The Revised Unfinished Chapter of the Harrah History Book now in progress#10\|#10]]

Thomas Kinkead, in 1771, purchased from Jacob Passinger a tract of land in Greenbrier called Spring Lick, once the property of Christian Sanders, orphan. [[Evernote/Archive/Kincaid History, The Revised Unfinished Chapter of the Harrah History Book now in progress#11\|#11]]

May 18, 1772: Robert Guin of Augusta County sold to _Thomas Kinkead_, _Blacksmith_, of the county of Augusta 43 acres on great river of Calfpasture, "joining a tract of land in the possession of Wm. Kinkead and said _Thomas Kinkead_". Witnesses: Thomas Hughart, James Hodge, John Carlile. [[Evernote/Archive/Kincaid History, The Revised Unfinished Chapter of the Harrah History Book now in progress#12\|#12]]

John Marshall summoned, 1780, to show cause why grant shall not issue to _Thoma\_\_Kinkead_ for land in Greenbrier claimed by settlement. (Augusta Co., VA Court records, Nov., 1782, p. 378)

August , 1780: _Thomas Kinkade_ vs. Sarah Cocke. Slander. (Augusta Co. , VA Court records, August, 1780, p. 376)

August 20, 1785: Thomas Kinkade, returned no inhabitant. (Augusta Co., VA Court Order Book XIX, p. 242)

June, 1799: Kinkead vs. Donnelly. Thomas Kinkead, in 1771, purchased from Jacob Passinger a tract of land in Greenbrier called Spring Lick, once the property of Christian Sanders, orphan. Christian Passinger deposes, 1797, that he and Christian Saunders made the first improvement on the land prior to 1751, when it was surveyed. (Chalkley's Chronicles, p. 414)

Bill Filed 1803: Kinkade vs. Cunningham. _Thomas Kinkade_ was a very ignorant and illiterate man. Walter Cunningham bought the land from Andrew Donnelly and is now living in Kentucky. .. William Kincaid was son of _Thomas_... Christopher Persinger deposes: That he, with Landers, first improved the land. (Chalkley's Chronicles, Augusta Co. Circuit Court Cases Ended - Old Style, Case #23 (or #22?), p. 513)

### Part 3 ... David, James, & Joseph Kincaid in Albemarle Co.

By the 1740's David Kincaid had purchased land in Augusta County (formed from Orange Co. In 1738) and in Albemarle County (formed from Louisa and Goochland Counties in 1744). Although he owned land in Augusta County, I believe he lived primarily in Albemarle County. According to Wood's History of Albemarle County, three brothers named David, Joseph, and James Kinkead [[Evernote/Archive/Kincaid History, The Revised Unfinished Chapter of the Harrah History Book now in progress#13\|#13]] settled in far western Albemarle County (which is near the Augusta County border). [[Evernote/Archive/Kincaid History, The Revised Unfinished Chapter of the Harrah History Book now in progress#14\|#14]]

**XXXXXXXX NEED TINKLING SPRING CHURCH RECORDS HERE XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX**

James died in 1762. Leaving three sons, Thomas, John, and James, and probably two more, Matthew and Andrew, and a daughter, the wife of Ninian Clyde. Joseph died in 1774. His children were Jean, the wife of Hugh Alexander, John, and Ruth, the wife of Andrew Grier. . . .All of the kindred bearing the name, seem to have removed from the county before the close of the last century \[18th Century\]. Its latest appearance on the records occurs in 1784, when Jean, the widow of James, sold to Abner Wood, a parcel of land in what is known as the Piper and Patrick neighborhood. She was at that time a resident of Rockbridge County. [[Evernote/Archive/Kincaid History, The Revised Unfinished Chapter of the Harrah History Book now in progress#15\|#15]]

Sherrralyn Kincaid Nichols, [[Evernote/Archive/Kincaid History, The Revised Unfinished Chapter of the Harrah History Book now in progress#16\|#16]] in her Kincaid web page, indicated that our Thomas Kincaid of Muddy Creek Mountain was born in Albemarle County in 1742 and she suggested he may be the above named son of James (who died in 1762) and Jean Kincaid of that county. The interesting thing about the widow Jean (sometimes spelled Jane) Kinkead is that she is a neighbor of Daniel O'Hara, Sr. when he owned land in Albemarle Co. In 1771-1775. Could her son Thomas be the Thomas Kincaid of Muddy Creek Mountain? The answer is apparently "No". A review of the Albemarle County records reveals that the Widow Jean Kincaid gave 207 acres to her son Thomas Kinkead in 1774. [[Evernote/Archive/Kincaid History, The Revised Unfinished Chapter of the Harrah History Book now in progress#17\|#17]] Thomas and his wife _Mary_ later sold this same land to Samuel Muse in 1779. [[Evernote/Archive/Kincaid History, The Revised Unfinished Chapter of the Harrah History Book now in progress#18\|#18]] (This is obviously not the same Thomas married to Hannah Tincher).

The early deeds involving the widow Jean Kincaid (Kinkead) and her son Thomas are as follows:

July 25, 1765: Deed from Andrew Woods to Jean Kinkead, relict of James Kinkead, deceased, both of Albemarle, 409 acres for L 35. On both sides of a Branch to the east of Armour Mtn. Being part of a John Chiswell grant. Neighbors: John Rodes, David Glen, James Glen, William Gregg. Witnesses: Joseph Kinkead, Thos. Kinkead (John's son), Thos. Kinkead (James' son).

April 14, 1774: Gift Deed from Jane Kinkead to Thomas Kinkead, her son, both of Albemarle, 207 acres for L 5. Neighbors: Chas. Roads (road to Charlottesville?), John Winkfield(?). Witnesses: James Logan, John Reed(?), Wm. Wood(?), Jr.

+

Oct 13, 1779: Deed from Thomas & Mary Kincade of Albemarle to Samuel Muse of Westmoreland, 207 acres for L 830. Neighbors: Jno. Winkfield, Chal Road, has. Lambert, Jean Kincade. No witnesses.

Nov 11, 1780: Deed from Jane Kinkade of Rockbridge Co. to Abner Wood of Albemarle, 200 acres for L 500. Neighbors: John Piper, Nathaniel Gibson, Jessee(?) Tate, Andrew Munroe, William Gregg, Anne Garland. No witnesses

However, there was another Thomas in Albemarle County as proven by the 1765 deed from Arthur Woods to Jean Kinkead. The deed was witnessed by Thomas Kinkead (James' son) and Thomas Kinkead (John's son).\*19 Other deeds, which are quoted later in this chapter, prove that our Thomas Kincaid was the son of John Kincaid:

The question of which John Kincaid was the father of our Thomas Kincaid is not easy to answer.

### Part 4 ... The John Kincaids of Albemarle & Augusta Counties

There were the following John Kincaids associated with Albemarle and Augusta Counties. Sorting out which was which among the various deeds in records may be ultimately impossible. The following is an attempt to provide some probable differentiation between the various John Kincaids:

#### 1) John Kincaid, Clerk
of New London, Chester Co. PA. He was an adult and an ordained minister by 1745 so he was probably born in 1720 or earlier. His wife was apparently named Annie. He purchased land in Orange County, Virginia in 1745, although there is no evidence that he lived in Virginia at the time. He came from Ireland as a licensed Presbyterian minister at some time before or during 1753 at which time he appeared in Pennsylvania records. It appears he was in Chester Co., Pennsylvania until about 1766 when he appeared in Augusta Co., VA records. He seems to have had difficulties with his neighbors which may explain his disappearance from the Augusta County records by the year 1769. He may have returned to Pennsylvania.

The following are Pennsylvania and Virginia records for the Rev. John Kincaid:

July 17, 1745: Orange Co. Deed from James Patton & John Lewis of Beverley Manor in Augusta Co. to John Kinkead of the same Co., 1061 acres for L 35. Great River of the Calfpasture. Neighbors John Preston, James Carole. Witnesses: David Kinkead, Robt Patton, Loftis Pullin.

There is no evidence of John the Clerk in any Albemarle records.\]

1753 (PA) The Rev. John Kinkead, licentiate from Ireland. His ordination was asked for on the part of the congregation of the Great Valley and Warrington. If he was a regularly settled pastor he did not remain long for in 1757 he was dismissed and publicly disowned by the Presbytery.

John Kingkade that on Wednesday, the 22nd day of this instant, about twelve of the clock at night, when he and his family were in bed and asleep, they were awakened by a noise out of ye house, upon which Mrs. Kingkade rose up and looking out saw two men which to the best of her knowledge, she says was Robert Nox and William Hamilton, dressed in women's clothes, on which she asked what they wanted, they making no answer, ran against the door and made several attempts to beat it open, but finding they could not, they pulled a table cloth out of the window, or hole in the house, and after it to pieces, went off. As the said John Kingkade and his wife, fearing they did intend some harm to their estate, or lives, and will still pursue their intended wickedness, these are, in his Majesty's name, to command you to take the said Robert Nox and William Hamilton and bring them before me, or some other justice of the peace for this county to answer the said complaint.

This John Kincaid appears in place of David Kincaid in one record and seems to have a close relationship with David. This is why John Kincaid, weaver, is easily confused with the son of David Kincaid who was also a John Kincaid. To make things even more confusing, their wives were both named Elizabeth. But John Kincaid, weaver, was older then John Kincaid (son of David) as evidenced by the ages of his children. In the years 1770-1771 John Kincaid, weaver, and his (1st?) wife Elizabeth transferred their land to their children who were apparently the following:

Matthew Kincaid, d. bef.. 1776 (and therefore not mentioned in father's will), Augusta Co., VA, m. Elizabeth McTeer.

Andrew Kincaid, adult in \_\_\_, married Jean (or Jane)

John Kincaid, Jr., adult in 1770 m. Ann (Graham?)

James Kincaid, adult in 1771

Robert Kincaid, adult in 1766, m. Anna Helena

The will of John Kincaid of Bath County, Virginia (who I believe to be the same as the Weaver [[Evernote/Archive/Kincaid History, The Revised Unfinished Chapter of the Harrah History Book now in progress#27a\|#27a]]) was dated July 2nd, 1801, and was probated in court at Bath County in April, 1813. The will is abstracted as follows:

ITEM: To wife Elizabeth, all movable property and living on my lands during her life.

ITEM: To my four sons, Andrew, John, Robert and James, and to daughter Isable who married Thomas Kinkead, $5.00 each together with what they have already have got to be their share of my estate.

ITEM: To son William, 332 acres on Eagle Creek, Fayette Ky.

NOTE: 332 is exactly half of the 664 acres John purchased in 1783. The land was originally in Fayette Co., but was actually in Woodford Co. at the time of the will.

ITEM: To son David, land I live on, above Lick Run, on a straight course to Bull Pasture Mountain.

ITEM: To son Ferdinand, land below Little Draft Run on a straight line to Bull Pasture Mountain.

ITEM: To son Charles L., all of the remaining land between the above two runs with the improvements thereon.

ITEM: Son Isaac to have his living on my lands during his life.

Elizabeth, wife of the above John Kincaid, followed her husband in death in 18\_\_. The terms of her and her husband's will, in which they appear to distinguish between "his children" and "her children" have led to the assumption that she was wife number two. John's first wife is also supposed to have been an Elizabeth. [[Evernote/Archive/Kincaid History, The Revised Unfinished Chapter of the Harrah History Book now in progress#28\|#28]] The terms of (2nd wife's?) Elizabeth's will are abstracted as follows:

... I Elizabeth Kinkead of Bath County and commonwealth of Virginia relict and Widow of the late John Kinkead of said county and state ...

ITEM: Negro Sally to live on place I now live with my son Charles L. in order to attend to my son Isaac.

ITEM: Negro Jack, son of Sally, to my son Ferdinand, his heirs.

ITEM: To son Charles L., my negro Else.

ITEM: To my daughter Isabela, my negro Milly and after her death to become property of Isabela's daughter Betsey.

ITEM: To son Charles L. his heirs, my negro boy Harry.

ITEM: Negro man George to care for son Isaac as long as he lives, then to be sold and price divided equally between my three sons David, Ferdinand and Charles L.

ITEM: To grand daughter Betsey, dau. of Ferdinand, the bed and furniture I now occupy.

ITEM: Rest of my property and cattle to be sold and distributed as follows:

First, the legacies left by my late husband to his five children Andrew, John, Robert, James and daughter Isable to be paid out of the proceeds and the residue as follows:

To sons Andrew, John, Robert or his heirs, James and William, $1.00., balance I will to my three sons David, Ferdinand and Charles L. and their heirs. Two cows are to be left for my son Isaac.

I appoint my three sons, David, Ferdinand and Charles L. as executors.

#### 3) John Kincaid married to Margaret
This John was an adult by 1762. Only two land records were found for him in Albemarle County.. This is apparently John, son of Joseph. This John sold his Albemarle land in 1765 and moved to Russell County, Virginia.

Dec. 8, 1762: Deed from John & David Lockhart to John Kinkead, all of Albemarle Co., 356 acres for L 80. South branch of the North Fork of Mechums River. Neighbors: Matthew Mills, John Lockharts, George Davidson. No witnesses

The following bible record is apparently the key to the identity of the children of this John Kincaid:

John Kinkead was born in the year of our Lord God, Sept. 14, 1736

Elisabeth his wife was born April the first, 1735.

And they were married April the 21st day in the year of our Lord 1756.

This Book was given to her by her father David Kinkead in 1756.

David Kinkead, son of John and Elisbeth Kinkead was born July 7th 1757

Bethiah Kinkead was born June 20, 1759.

#### 5) John Kincaid, son of James & Jean

**XXXXXXXX STILL NEED TO IDENTIFY HIM XXXXXXXXXXX**

### Part 5 ... Which John Kincaid was the father of Thomas Kincaid of Muddy Creek Mountain?

There is no evidence that John Kincaid, the Clerk of Chester Co. PA and his wife Annie had children although there are references to his "family" in at least two records.. Our Thomas Kincaid (married to Hannah Tincher) could possibly be his child but there is no evidence of a link. John Kincaid, b. 1736, son of David was too young to be Thomas' father. The John Kincaid who married Margaret was apparently Joseph's son and also too young to be the father of our Thomas Kincaid. I am inclined to believe that John the Weaver was the father of our Thomas Kincaid of Muddy Creek Mountain. Although John Kincaid, the weaver and his wife Elizabeth did not deed land to Thomas as they did their other apparent children nor was Thomas mentioned as a child in John's will, land was transferred to Thomas by Andrew who may have been Thomas' brother and John's son. Additionally, Thomas received land through his marriage connection to the Tincher family so he was not needful of farm land to support his family.

The following is my estimated reconstruction of the early families of Albemarle County. The birth dates, when no other information is available, is based on their first appearance in the records minus 20 years.

### Part 6 ... The Records for Thomas Kincaid of Muddy Creek Mountain

As stated previously, there are records in Albemarle County which identify our Thomas Kincaid as the son of John Kincaid (Kinkead). They are the earliest records in which we can positively identify our Thomas Kincaid and are as follows:

*July 5, 1765: Deed from Andrew Woods to Thomas Kinkead, son of John Kinkead, both of Albemarle, 211 acres for L 18. On the east & north of Armors Mtn. No neighbors given. Witnesses: Joseph Kinkead, Thos. Kinkead, Jean Kinkead.*

&

*Nov. 26, 1771: Deed from Thomas Kinkead, son of John Kinkead, & Hannah his wife to Benjamin Coffey, all of Albemarle, 211 acres for L 20. To the east & north of Amours Mtn. Neighbors: John Patrick. Witnesses: John Coffey, John Garland, Natha'l Garland*

Therefore, the first certain record for our Thomas Kincaid is the July 5, 1765 record in Albemarle County. We know that Thomas' daughter Margaret was born about 1760, so Thomas was probably married in 1760 or earlier. A birth date in the range of 1740-42 would seem to a good estimate. The mention of wife Hannah in the 1771 deed proves that this was the Thomas married to Hannah Tincher. Although Samuel Tincher, Hannah's father, is associated in most research with his land transactions in Augusta Co., other deeds in Albemarle prove he owned land in the same area as the Kincaids.

The deeds for our Thomas Kincaid were witnessed by Jean Kincaid, Thomas Kincaid (son of James and Jean), and Joseph Kincaid. In addition, our Thomas had witnessed deeds for Jean Kincaid. This is evidence of a relationship but exactly what relationship is unknown.

A few years later, our Thomas Kincaid purchased land in Augusta County, Virginia as follows:

*August 17, 1770: Andrew Kinkead and wife Jean of the County of Augusta sold to _Thomas Kinkead_ of the County of Augusta 45 acres on the main branch of the Calfpasture River, "corner to said _Thomas Kinkead's_ land". Witnesses: Jno. Poage, John Finley, William Tincher.

*November 18, 1770: George Campbell & _Samuel Tincher_ and wife _Margaret_ of the County of _Albemarle_ sold to _Thos. Kinkead_ of the County of Augusta 115 acres lying on the great river of the Calfpasture originally granted to Wm. Preston by patent and conveyed by Preston to Campbell & _Tincher_. Witnesses: John Bigham, Andrew Kinkead, Joseph Kinkead. [[Evernote/Archive/Kincaid History, The Revised Unfinished Chapter of the Harrah History Book now in progress#36\|#36]]

The above two parcels of land were sold by Thomas and Hannah Kincaid just before the beginning of the Revolutionary War:

*February 15, 1776: _Thomas Kinkead_ and wife _Hannah_ of Augusta County sold to Tully Davitt of Augusta County 260 acres on the great river of the Calfpasture, originally a part of a patent to Preston and conveyed (215 acres of it) to Campbell & _Tincher_ and conveyed by them to _Thomas Kinkead_ _and_ another parcel of 45 acres which had been conveyed to _Thomas Kinkead_ by Andrew Kinkead who had received the land by patent. Witnesses: William Bowyer, Robert Gambell, Thomas Bell. [[Evernote/Archive/Kincaid History, The Revised Unfinished Chapter of the Harrah History Book now in progress#37\|#37]]

In 1781 Thomas Kincaid purchased land in Botetourt County, which was cut off from Augusta County in 1770. The purchase was as follows:

*April 10, 1781: Thomas Jefferson Esquire Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia...unto the said _Thomas Kinkead_ assignee of John Anderson who was assignee of William Greenlee a certain tract or parcel of land containing one hundred and sixty acres by survey bearing date the ninth day of June one thousand seven hundred & seventy one lying and being in the County of Botetourt joining the lands of Hugh Barkleys land in the fork of James River...near Cedar Bridge.. [[Evernote/Archive/Kincaid History, The Revised Unfinished Chapter of the Harrah History Book now in progress#38\|#38]]

Cedar Bridge was the name then given to the natural rock formation more commonly named "Natural Bridge", which is located in the extreme southern end of Rockbridge County near the Bedford County line. Rockbridge County (named after the natural bridge) was formed from Botetourt Co. in 1778.

Thomas Kincaid
had apparently moved from Albemarle/Augusta Counties to Botetourt/Rockbridge County by the early 1780's because his name appears on routine court matters in Rockbridge court records. The court house in Fincastle, Rockbridge County, has a tithable list starting in 1783 at which time Thomas is listed as one free male above 21, no slaves, three horses, and eight heads of cattle. He is not shown on the 1784 list or thereafter.

On August 21, 1783 there is a court matter involving Thomas Kincaid which is not routine:

_Thomas Kinkade_
was "charged with felony in stealing one Cuting knife the property of William Crawford". Thomas was committed to jail and appeared on this date before the court testifying in his own defense. Witnesses were called and a probably case of guilt was found and he was required to put up bond to appear before the next Grand Jury. Hugh Barclay and Hugh Bradford put up bonds of 250 pounds each, levied upon their goods and chattels. Witnesses for the Commonwealth against _Thomas Kincaid_ who were to appear at the Grand Jury were Margaret Crawford, William Millar, and Joseph Stephenson. [[Evernote/Archive/Kincaid History, The Revised Unfinished Chapter of the Harrah History Book now in progress#39\|#39]]

The reason I believe the above record pertains to our Thomas Kincaid is because he was the only Thomas Kincaid in Rockbridge County at this time and the bondsmen, Hugh Barclay and Hugh Bradford, were his neighbors, as evidenced by the deeds. The last record in Rockbridge County for Thomas Kincaid was as follows:

*December 11, 1783: _Thomas Kinkaid_ and wife _Hannah_ of Rockbridge County sold to James Ochiltree of Rockbridge County 160 acres "in the forks of James River". Witnesses: Wm. McElhaney, Hugh Bradford, and Caleb Sisson. [[Evernote/Archive/Kincaid History, The Revised Unfinished Chapter of the Harrah History Book now in progress#40\|#40]]

In a book about the Ochiltree family, a somewhat confusing history of the above land is given:

Another interesting old document is the survey and plat of 160 acres of land, made for William Greenlee, June 17,1771, by John Trimble; granted to _Thomas Kinkead_, by patent, Apr. 10, 1791; re-granted to James Ochiltree, inclusively, with 21 3/4 acres more, under warrant, 14,274. To the southwest of this tract, is the tract, marked in the copy of the survey, "T. Jefferson, 157 acres surveyed by John Trimble." The patent is dated July 8, 1774. [[Evernote/Archive/Kincaid History, The Revised Unfinished Chapter of the Harrah History Book now in progress#41\|#41]]

I found the patent listed above. It is dated Apr. 10, 1981. Therefore the patent was not obtained after the sale to Ochiltree.

The above indicates Thos. Kincaid obtained the patent after the sale. The book indicates in other passages that James Ochiltree owned land near natural bridge which further pinpoints the land of Thomas Kincaid as bordering the Natural Bridge. The Natural Bridge itself was purchased by Thomas Jefferson, who as Governor of Virginia, had signed the original land grant in Botetourt/Rockbridge County to Thomas Kincaid.

Our Thomas Kincaid settled in Greenbrier County by the early 1780's based on routine court records in that County. He had married Hannah Tincher [[Evernote/Archive/Kincaid History, The Revised Unfinished Chapter of the Harrah History Book now in progress#42\|#42]] about 1760. His birth date is estimated at about 1740. He would have been of the right age to sign the deed from Arthur Woods to Jean Kincaid in 1765. [[Evernote/Archive/Kincaid History, The Revised Unfinished Chapter of the Harrah History Book now in progress#43\|#43]]

The children of Thomas Kincaid and Hannah Tincher were:

Margaret (Peggy) Kincaid (1760-1840) married Charles Harrah

John Kincaid (1761- ) married Elizabeth Hannah Gillespie

Elizabeth Kincaid (1766-after 1850) married Daniel Harrah, Jr.

Samuel Kincaid (1767-1843) married Mary Tincher

Thomas Kincaid (1770-1844) married Hannah Viney and/or Elizabeth Murdoch

Francis Kincaid (1773-1826) married Nancy Murdock

George Campbell Kincaid (1773- ) married Joanna Baldwin [[Evernote/Archive/Kincaid History, The Revised Unfinished Chapter of the Harrah History Book now in progress#44\|#44]]

William Kincaid (1777-1860) married Mary Ann Tincher

Hannah Kincaid (1777- ) married James M. Walker

Sarah (Salle) Kincaid (1781- ) married Thomas Terry [[Evernote/Archive/Kincaid History, The Revised Unfinished Chapter of the Harrah History Book now in progress#45\|#45]]

Most of the definitive proof of the children of Thomas Kincaid is provided by a lawsuit instigated in 1811 by the heirs of Samuel Baldwin against Thomas Kincaid. I have excerpted here only those records which generally explain the lawsuit and which provide proof that Elizabeth Harrah was Thomas Kincaid's daughter and Elizabeth's sons were Thomas Harrah and probably Matthew Harrah:

Oct. 19, 1811: William Baldwin, one of plaintiffs, applied to James Withrow, justice of peace, to intervene because _Thomas Kincaid, Sr._ informed him \[Baldwin\] that he had sold his \[_Kincaid's_\] land in said county with a view of shortly removing to the state of Kentucky and Baldwin believed that he \[Kincaid\] shortly intended to leave the Commonwealth. Baldwin wanted the court to compel _Thomas Kincaid, Sr._ to put up some form of security before his removal to "foreign parts". In this document, Baldwin charged that _Thomas Kincaid_ received 2 land warrants from his father , Samuel Baldwin, one warrant for 1,030 acres and another warrant for 1,936 ½ acres which the said Kincaid was to survey, enter and divide between them. William Baldwin charged that _Kincaid_ fraudulently disposed of the land in smaller parcels without giving the heirs of Samuel Baldwin their fair share.

Sept. 11, 1813: Deposition of Thomas Kincaid, Jr. (Son of the defendant) was taken on behalf of the Chancery Court of Staunton, VA. He stated that _Thomas Kincaid, Sr._ had about eight slaves, all of which were transferred to his sons or others. He further stated that _Thomas Kincaid, Sr._ had moved away \[apparently from Muddy Creek\] after the sale of his land to Lick Creek.

Nov. 6, 1827: Excerpts from the statement of James Shanklin, Commisioner, were as follows:

"Thos. Kincaid Jr. convey'd the balance of the said deed of 285 acres which is 265 1/4 acres to _Thos. Harra_ by deed bearing date the 18th nov. 1817 & the land is now in said _Harra's_ possession & includes the balance of the 150 acres survey."

"551 acres of said survey of 1,334 acres was conveyed by _Thos. Kincaid Senr_. To his _grandson_, Mathew Harra by deed of bargain & sale bearing date the 25th day of Aug. 1809 and 551 acres was conveyed by Mathew Harra to Thos. Terry by deed bearing date the 22nd day of June 1819."

Nov. 9, 1816: A revised complaint by Baldwin's heirs which included more defendants:

"...that _Elizabeth Harrow_, a daughter of the defendant _Thomas \[Kincaid, Sr._\] and her son _Thomas Harrow_ are in possession of a certain quantity of land to wit \_\_\_ acres secured by virtue of said land warrants and when was given to them or one of them as a voluntary donation by the said _Thomas Kincaid_. That _Thomas Harrow_ is also in possession of about fifty acres of land secured by virtue of said warrants, lying in Muddy Creek in Greenbrier Co. Which your orators state to be very valuable, and which was transferred by the said defendant _Thomas Kincaid_ to his son Thomas Kincaid as a voluntary donation without any consideration whatever, and which was sold by the said Thomas Kincaid, Junr. To said _Thomas Harrow_ the latter well knowing that your orators claimed one moiety of the same, before and at the time he purchased it, and still has a considerable part of the purchase money in his hand, and also well knowing that the said land was held by virtue of the aforesaid warrants."

Thomas and Hannah Kincaid
lived on Muddy Creek Mountain adjacent to land owned by the Harrahs. It was therefore natural that two of his daughters, Margaret and Elizabeth would have married Harrahs. Besides the connection on Muddy Creek Mountain, there is an acquaintance between the families that dates back to the early 1770's when Daniel O'Hara. Sr. purchased land in Albemarle County near Armour's Mountain.

### ENDNOTES:

#### 1.
The source of this tradition was apparently Dr. Herbert Clarke Kincaid of Washington. D.C., a g-g-g-grandson of one of the nephews, Samuel Kincaid. From "An Assortment of Kincaid Papers", LDS Film #1697700, Item 6. The only aspects of the tradition I can confirm are David Kincaid's appearances in Spotsylvania County and other Virginia counties from the 1730's as evidenced by deeds and court records. The supposed nephews, Samuel, George, James and Robert are not examined in this chapter. Although some of their descendants appear later in Greenbrier County, there is no apparent relation to our Thomas Kincaid.

Parents of Margaret Lockhart were James Horatio Lockhart & wife Margaret of Scotland. She was apparently related to Jacob Lockhart, Sr. and by marriage to Matthew Arbuckle, both of whom are involved in the history of the early Harrahs in Greenbrier Co., VA. (From LDS ancestral files)

#### 8.
Larry Shuck states he came in 1715 to Lancaster Co., PA. Other researchers references to Margaret Lockhart state that she came from Lancaster Co.

#### 8a.
Susan Liedke of Seattle, who is a descendant of Andrew Kincaid & Mary of Augusta and Greenbrier counties, wrote to inform me that William the Stiller was the son of Andrew Kincaid, Sr. (A William was a son of an Andrew per Chalkley's records). The Andrew married to Mary was probably Andrew, Jr. the same who gave the land to the congregation of dissenters on the calfpasture in 1773. There is no indication he was the son of Andrew Sr., just that he was the younger of the two.

It was probably only an assumption on Wood's part that the three were brothers. There is no documentation in the book to this effect.

A John Kincaid appears in church records in 1747 and is too old to be the son of Joseph named in the account. He must be either John the weaver or possibly, John, son of James.

Albemarle County in Virginia by Rev. Edgar Woods. C.J. Carrier Co., Bridgewater, Virginia. It is interesting to note that the widow Jean Kincaid appeared in Rockbridge County in 1784 at about the same time as our Thomas Kincaid was there.

#### 16.
I had always assumed the roots of our Thomas Kincaid were to be found in Augusta County. It was the information provided by Barbara Vines Little of Orange Virginia about the Daniel O'Hara deeds in Albemarle, and Sherralyn Kincaid Nichols' Albemarle information in her web page that led me to research the Kincaids of Albemarle County. So I am indebted to both.

This is from an e-mail from Dennis House (8/30/99) to the Kincaid mail list in response to a message from Barbara Mihalcik who stated her ancestress, Sarah Kincaid, born in Windham, NH in 1861, was thought to be either the son of Samuel Kincaid or of the Rev. John Kincaid "who went to Windham in 1760 from Chester Co., PA".

#### 27.
These last 3 records, 1766-69 in Augusta Co., for the Rev. John Kincaid are from Chalkley's Chronicles. In Alice Gedge's temporary website, she attributed these entries to John Kincaid, b. c1745, son of Thomas Kincaid and Margaret Lockhart. This John married Margaret \_\_\_. And according to file #561.704 in the Chester Co., PA Historical Society, as quoted by Alice, he was a Reverend. At some later date this family moved to Woodford Co., KY which could possibly tie him to William Kincaid & Eleanor Guy who may or may not have been the son of Thomas & Margaret Kincaid (Doug McGuire disputes this). If these records in Augusta Co. are for the younger John and not John Kincaid, Clerk of Chester Co., PA, then the Clerk may have never lived in Virginia.

#### 27a.
Susan Liedke believes that John of Bath may not have been the same person as John the Weaver and that each had children with similar names. This might explain the apparent surplus of some names in the early Augusta records. In preparing the time line for this chapter, I have John the weaver born about 1714 and dying (as John of Bath) about 1813 which is a very long life (99 years) if he was one and the same person.

#### 28.
Some undocumented research has referred to one of his wives as Elizabeth Hamilton. John the Weaver did live close to Andrew Hamilton (perhaps the reason for a son being named Andrew) as noted in the 1769 deed from John the Clerk to Samuel Griffin, which has John Kincaid and Andrew Hamilton as living adjacent to the land sold. In addition, according to George Diehl in his Rockbridge County Notebook, Andrew Hamilton was married to Martha Kincaid, a sister of William Kincaid (thought by Diehl to be the William married to Eleanor Guy).

#### 29.
As far as I know there is no direct evidence that John Kincaid, son of David, was married to Elizabeth "Logan". However the circumstantial evidence is strong. For example a Bethial Logan is mentioned in this deed and John, son of David, gad a daughter named Bethial who witnessed the will of her grandfather, David Kincaid. I have seen it stated in other's research that Elizabeth Logan was the daughter of Robert & Bethiah Logan.

#### 31.
In 1754 a petition for a mill on the place of Andrew Lockridge "who lately settled here" was signed by Andrew and John Kincaid.

#### 31a.
The children of John Kincaid and Ann Graham were Lanty (Lancelot) Kincaid and Matthew Kincaid. Lanty and Matthew lived in Greenbrier Co. in the Muddy Creek and Little Meadow areas and were neighbors of the children and grandchildren of Thomas Kincaid & Hannah Tincher. Lanty's son Matthew Kincaid (1799-1828) married Elizabeth Harrah, daughter of Daniel Harrah, Jr. and Elizabeth (Kincaid) Harrah.

#### 32.
There was a will in Greenbrier County, Virginia dated March 3, 1795 (probated July 28, 1795) for a Thomas Kincaid of Peter's Mountain who left a widow named Mary.

#### 33.
Based on information in Alice Gedge's website in which the children of John & Agnes were James, Jean, Agnes, Andrew, Joseph, Elizabeth, Sarah, and John.

#### 34.
According to Laura Greer, Andrew Grier (Greer) was born in Ireland in 1730, married Ruth Kincaid about 1753, moved to Botetourt & Washington Co., VA, and died in Tennessee before Oct., 1809. He was short of stature and called "wee Andy". He and Ruth Kincaid had two children, Jospeh and James, before Ruth died (before 1775) and Andrew remarried Mary Vance. Andrew Greer was said to be one of the first two white men to settle below the Virginia line in Tennessee and he accumulated a considerable estate from Indian trading.

#### 35.
Augusta Co. VA Deed Book 16, pp. 490-493. Andrew Kinkead had received the patent from Robert Beverley, Esq. bearing patent bearing the date May 19, 1772. The land at that time was described as 230 acres on the "little river of the Calfpasture".

Hannah Tincher was the daughter of Samuel Tincher (1718-1791) and Margaret (Campbell?). Samuel left a will naming Hannah Kincaid as an heir. A niece of Hannah Kincaid, Margaret Tincher, married William Harrah. It is supposed that George Campbell, who with William Tincher sold the tract in Augusta County to Thomas Kincaid, was the father or brother of Margaret (Campbell?), mother of Hannah Tincher. Thomas and Hannah named a son George Campbell Kincaid. It is interesting to note that on March 16, 1785 Mary Hacket, late Mary Campbell, admx. Of George Campbell, dec'd was summoned to give counter security (per Augusta Co. Court records quoted in Chalkley). The Hacket(t) family has ties to the Harrah family.

#### 43.
A "Widow Kincaid" was mentioned in Greenbrier Co. Court records as early as 1783. Could she be the widow Jean Kincaid previously in Rockbridge County? Or could she be the mother of Thomas Kincaid of Muddy Creek Mountain?

#### 44.
Daughter of Samuel Baldwin. See more about Samuel Baldwin in the chapter on the Baldwin family. Samuel Baldwin was not of sterling character. He was actually Samuel Ford, who fled from New Jersey to Virginia to escape hanging for counterfeiting.

#### 45.
The family information is from Larry Shuck's book Our Families and from Sheralynn Kincaid Nichols Kincaid home page. Their information generally agrees. The same family list from Lois Kincaid Dorsey's The Tincher Tribe has some variations; she adds an Andrew and a Kincaid Kincaid and she lists a George and a Campbell Kincaid as two different persons.
